# Contract Starter - A simple scaffolding for Solidity contracts

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. 

It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

## Getting Started

Clone, open in the terminal and run:

```bash 
npm i
```

## Run tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Deploy contract on localhost

In a terminal, run:
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

In another terminal run:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
